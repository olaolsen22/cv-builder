    "content": "I have been in the software development industry for almost two years now. As a Software Engineer, I am mostly focused on the Front-end side when it comes to development. I am also capable of doing tasks related to the back-end. Since front-end development is my forte, I am regularly being transferred back and forth between projects due to the severity of existing UI/UX issues. Besides that, I am usually the person they point to when it comes to visual design choices for a project.\n\nBesides my hard skills, I can effectively communicate with my team members. Not only that but with the clients as well. I generally know when to raise issues or potential issues in the future. I can even learn new technologies fast since this is a common thing in the industry."
